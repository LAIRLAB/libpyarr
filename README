libpyarr makes it embarrassingly easy to:
- write some Python code that uses numpy arrays
- discover that part of it is slow
- rewrite that part in C++
- call the new C++ function, passing in numpy arrays and/or returning them without excessive copying. 

It is sufficiently convenient to do this that users of this library tend to completely cease
writing top-level executables in C++.

So, for example, if you would like to pass a numpy array of int32's into a C++ function, you can have
a C++ module: 

#include <boost_common.h>

void foo(pyarr<int> myarr) 
{
    for (int i=0; i<myarr.dims[0]; i++) {
        for (int j=0; j<myarr.dims[2]; j++) {
            myarr[ind(i,j)] = 0.0;
        }
    }
}

The ind(i,j) syntax works for arrays of up to 4 dimensions; above that you can 
access the data pointer directly with myarr.data. 

To create a new uninitialized numpy array in C++ and return it: 

pyarr<unsigned char> bar() 
{
    long int dims[] = {10, 20, 30};
    pyarr<unsigned char> ret(3, dims);
    return ret;
}

To expose these functions to Python:

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(libmy_cpp_module)
{
    def("foo", foo);
    def("bar", bar);
}

Then in your CMakeLists.txt:

include(common.cmake)
include(boost_common.cmake)

add_library(my_cpp_module my_cpp_module.cc)
set_target_properties(my_cpp_module PROPERTIES SUFFIX ".so") 
# need the above or else it will be called a .dylib on OS X and python won't import it
target_link_libraries(my_cpp_module boost_common ${Boost_LIBRARIES} ${PYTHON_LIBRARIES})

Then your new library will be in lib/, and you can either add an __init__.py file to your lib/ 
directory, copy said library somewhere else, or add your lib/ directory to your $PYTHONPATH. 
Import it with 'import libmy_cpp_module'. 

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- When you pass a pyarr by value from anywhere to anywhere else, the array data is NOT COPIED. 
Normally the Python reference count is just managed in a sensible way by the constructors and
destructor. If you would like a copy, you can say mypyarr.copy(). For this reason, it is 
never recommended that you pass pyarrs by reference or by pointer, because there is no benefit
to doing so, and you risk messing up the refcounts. 

- You cannot create a view into a numpy array (e.g. with myarr[::-1, ...]) and pass it into a 
C++ function expecting a pyarr. If you have a view into an array and you would like to pass it, 
you can create a copy of it with .copy() in Python and then pass the copy in.
